His initial venture into the world of quick money began with stealing catalytic converters and selling them to local thugs. His skill and dedication didn't go unnoticed by the gang's leader, who recognized Roland's potential and decided to test it. The leader's proposition was simple yet risky: drive to Miami, pick up a package, and return to New York City. Roland knew the package contained cocaine, but the prospect of such a task excited him. This was more than just a job; it was a chance to ascend in a world where his skills were valued. Despite the dangers involved, Roland eagerly accepted the challenge, seeing it as an opportunity to prove his worth and solidify his place in this shadowy underworld. This journey was not just about delivering a package; it was about navigating a path filled with risks and opportunities, a path that could either lead to success or dire consequences."
