                  "text": "Years pass, and Joan's decision to move to Greece proves to be transformative. Her daughter, now fluent in Greek and enriched by diverse experiences, heads to university with a global perspective. Joan and Ioulianos's relationship deepens, built on mutual respect and shared values. They start a small business together, a café that becomes a hub for locals and tourists alike, symbolizing their journey and the merging of their worlds. This café, adorned with photos and memorabilia from both their cultures, stands as a testament to their enduring love and the power of embracing change and new beginnings."
