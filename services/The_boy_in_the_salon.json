    "text": "In a bustling city, an 8-year-old boy entered a cozy hair salon, hand in hand with his mother. The salon, a world of scissors and style, was new and exciting for him. He sat in the waiting area, swinging his legs, watching people come and go, each leaving transformed. As the hours ticked by, the salon's charm faded into anxiety. His mother hadn't returned. Confused, he approached the hairdressers, his voice small in the buzzing room. They didn't recognize him, their faces a mix of confusion and annoyance. They harshly told him to leave, not knowing who he was. Alone and bewildered, he stood at the threshold of the salon, the city's noise engulfing him, as he grappled with the realization that his mother was gone."

Each conversation led to more confusion, as no one recalled seeing such a vehicle. This pursuit not only deepened the mystery of his arrival at the salon but also made him question his own memories.",
